Basically this web application takes following input from user (Age, weight, height, carbs intake, fats, proteins etc) and does some operations given below
Technologies used:
  1. Backend framework - Django
  2. Front end - Bootstrap, HTML
  3. For Graphs - Chart.js

In the next step user can select the trigger upon satisfying which rule engine runs

Based on if the condition satisfied, We will redirect him to the same page or analysis page where he can perform 3 operations:
  1. Copy a value to another
  2. Do basic arthematic operations on the given values
  3. Do graph for variation of any 2 items (Max Quardilateral equation)

End results snippets
1. Graph output: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61613753/222072809-9da59943-6d7f-41c1-bda3-1095ad919723.png)
2. Updation output: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61613753/222072934-ab59bb69-fc90-4678-b18c-a6894cef850f.png)


Drawbacks I myself found:
1. Mostly hardcoded the input fields due to time constraint - Should have taken the variables dynamically.
2. Some input validations in frontend 
3. UI can be enhanced a bit.
